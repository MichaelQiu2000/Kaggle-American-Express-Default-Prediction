# Kaggle-American-Express-Default-Prediction

### This project is a silver medal solution in Kaggle Competition [American Express - Default Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction)

We use LightGBM as our main model. As a co-author, I pulished a [paper](A LightGBM based Default Prediction Method for American Express.pdf) in IEEE.

My main contribute code is [Data Processing](DataProcess.ipynb) and [Modeling](Train.ipynb)
