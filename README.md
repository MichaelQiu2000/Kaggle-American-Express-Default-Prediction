# Kaggle-American-Express-Default-Prediction

### This project is a silver medal solution in Kaggle Competition [American Express - Default Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction)

We use LightGBM as our main model. This is my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/michaeljyqiu)

**As a co-author, I pulished a [paper](A%20LightGBM%20based%20Default%20Prediction%20Method%20for%20American%20Express.pdf) in IEEE. This is the [acceptance letter](IEEE%20Acceptance%20Letter.pdf)**

**My contribitions of code are [Data Processing](DataProcess.ipynb) and [Modeling](Train.ipynb)**
